    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be focusing on **Image Conditioning** feature, which generates outputs that follow the layout and structure of a user-supplied reference image by providing it along with a text prompt. Two modes are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Canny Edge: Extract prominent edges from the reference image to guide the generation process.\n",
    "- Segmentation: Define specific regions/objects within the reference image for the model to generate content aligned with those areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "OctankFashion can leverage the Image Conditioning feature to automatically generate multiple variations of their ad creatives. For example, they can create different versions of a wedding dress image by adjusting the visual focus, background, or styling elements based on the reference images provided. This enables them to rapidly test and optimize their ad content, responding to customer preferences and emerging trends more effectively.\n"
