# Generating Synthetic Data and Distilling Knowledge to Fine-Tune Smaller Models with Amazon Nova Pro

## **Description**
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to implement knowledge distillation using Amazon Nova Pro as the teacher model to transfer its knowledge to Amazon Nova Micro, a smaller student model. The notebook provides a comprehensive guide through the knowledge distillation pipeline, including environment setup, generation of synthetic training data by the teacher model, and the distillation process where the student model learns to mimic the teacher's behavior. We show how to capture the teacher model's learned representations and probability distributions, which are then used to guide the training of the more compact student model while maintaining performance quality.

## **Introduction**
In this notebook, we explore how to utilize Amazon Nova Pro to create high-quality, concise training data for fine-tuning smaller models. This approach enhances the performance of smaller models by leveraging the strengths of a larger model.

## **Setup and Configuration**
We start by setting up the necessary environment, including installing required libraries and configuring the SageMaker session. This section also covers how to load the Amazon Nova Pro model and prepare it for data generation.

## **Synthetic Data Generation using Amazon Nova Pro**
In this section, we generate synthetic data using Amazon Nova Pro. The notebook includes functions to create instructional prompts and corresponding outputs, ensuring the generated data is diverse and suitable for fine-tuning.

## **Distillation by Fine-Tuning Amazon Nova Micro**
Here, we demonstrate how to perform distillation by fine-tuning the smaller Amazon Nova Micro model using the synthetic dataset. This section includes preparing synthetic data as training dataset, setting up the training parameters, and running the fine-tuning process.

## **Evaluation and Validation**
After fine-tuning, we evaluate the performance of the Amazon Nova Micro model. This section covers methods to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness, including generating evaluation reports.

## **Conclusion**
The notebook concludes with a summary of the knowledge distillation process and highlights how the teacher model's expertise is effectively transferred to the smaller student model. We demonstrate how the larger teacher model's soft probability distributions and intermediate representations help create high-quality training signals for the student model, resulting in improved performance compared to direct training.
