# Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) with Amazon Nova

The code in this folder demonstrates how to leverage Amazon Nova models and the AWS Bedrock Converse API for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). Our goal is to extract valuable information from PDF and image invoices—both as unstructured summaries and as structured data—using a Jupyter Notebook workflow. In addition, we use Amazon Nova to generate the required tool configuration (toolConfig) for extracting structured data from documents.

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) solution that leverages:
- AWS Bedrock Converse API – to interact with Amazon Nova models for document analysis.
- Amazon Nova Models – to process and extract information from PDF and scanned invoices.
- Custom Tool Configuration – generated by Amazon Nova to force the model to produce structured output.

Using a Jupyter Notebook, you can see how to:
- Summarize invoice content.
- Extract structured data (like invoice numbers, guest details, dates, costs, etc.) using a custom blueprint.
- Aggregate insights from multiple documents to answer business questions.

## Goals
- Unstructured Summarization: Extract key insights from PDF invoices.
- Structured Data Extraction: Use a custom tool configuration to force the model to output structured JSON data from invoices with a consistent layout.
- Business Insights: Aggregate data from multiple invoices to derive actionable business insights.
- Tool Generation: Utilize Amazon Nova to automatically generate the required tool configuration for data extraction.

## Repository Contents
- `01_document_understanding_invoices_processing.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code cells to process PDF invoices. It demonstrates summarization, structured extraction using a custom tool, and insight generation.
- `invoices/`: A folder containing sample PDF invoices (e.g., test_invoice_0_1.pdf, test_invoice_0_2.pdf) used as input for the notebook.
- `README.md`: This file, which explains this project, how to use it, and the underlying concepts.
